Hi all,

It's been a while since the last post. Those days we were in the early days of a Kickstarter campaign.  The result was awesome, reaching the funding goal some hours before the deadline!

Since then, we've been working closely with some of the backers and our design team to fulfill our Kickstarter commitments.  But now, we can say we have definitively sent the game for printing. Our partners in this first adventure will be AGR Priority, with long experience in producing board & card games.

You may think the adventure has come to an end... but this is just the beginning! Stay tunned for fresh news to come next week.

Thanks for following us :-)

The Team.
