    *Have you ever wondered what it would be like to be an economic bigwig?
    Do the economic headlines sound like a foreign, archaic language to you?
    Do you like social games?*

    If you answered yes to any of the above, you've come to the right place!

    The Lord of the P.I.G.S. is a fast-paced multiplayer economy simulation
    game set up in the fictional Republic of Meridia, a melting pot of the
    southern european countries.  You and your friends will take the role of
    Meridia's bigwigs and will vie for economic supremacy through presentation
    meetings, voting sessions, public opinion polls, unexpected events and
    widespread backstabbing.

    The Lord of the P.I.G.S. is a game for 4 players and takes between 20
    minutes and 30 minutes to complete, depending on how the players act and
    react.

    The Lord of the P.I.G.S. will come in a convenient, portable box that holds
    all the contents you need to play, anytime, anywhere:

      + 4 different Action decks (1 for each Character) of 29 cards each, for a total of 116 cards
      + 1 Event deck with 20 cards
      + 1 Board, with 5 score markers

    The game is not ready to ship yet, and it's being funded
    [via Kickstarter][kickstarter], where you can help it become a reality and
    get your copy of the game and many extra content!
