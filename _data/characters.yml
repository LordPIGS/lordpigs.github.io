    To talk about **Gustavo Mendez Uriz** means to talk about energy in Meridia.
    He is the son of Borja Mendez, owner of the most of the hydroelectric
    production and Adele Uriz, whose family owned the Meridian oil & gas
    importer, producer and distributor. Gustavo's romances have topped the
    tabloids often, and most of the "beautiful people" attend his summer
    parties in his idillic island in the Mediterranean. But Gustavo is not a
    rich playboy, he knows his business and takes good care to grow it.
