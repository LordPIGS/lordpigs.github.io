    There's nothing in this life that you prefer to the lights and flashes of
    the cameras.  They make you feel important, and are a nice reminiscence of
    your old days, when you were a star of the screen.  Well... maybe that's
    not true.  Since you became Head of State, you've found something better in
    the masses roaring your name: *"PRESIDENT! PRESIDENT!!"* So your absolute
    priority is to secure your reelection for another term, and you know how to
    achieve it.  Populist speeches, expensive Meridian tailored suits, and your
    best weapon: the combo of your perfect tanned skin and your pristine smile.
    The next election will be a cakewalk.

    You remember it clearly: *"He's not going to make it"*, *"Nobody can save
    the Holding from fading into oblivion"*, *"Meridia's position in the global
    economy is an unsurmountable hindrance"*... And despite it all, you saved
    your family's business, and even expanded into new sectors.
    Yes, some sacrifices were needed, but that concerned mostly third parties.
    Acceptable losses, of course.  You have got big plans for the future, as
    the world is full of opportunities if you know where to look: new markets,
    new product lines, and so on.
    The masses are eager for more trinkets and you are happy to oblige...

    "Money is the key to the world, and finance is the key to money" your
    father used to say.  And you've adopted his wisdom as your motto.
    While some brand your practices as questionable at best, it is crystal
    clear that they work.  Your finance empire grows every day, and as a result
    you have one finger in every pie, in Meridia and in a lot of countries
    worldwide.  The crisis, while scary at first, has yielded a positive
    balance in your accounts after you pushed the correct buttons.
    Because when used properly, finance is not only a key, it is also a leash.

    Meridia is full of jealous people!  They envy everything you own: the
    mansions, the yachts, the cars, the select parties and friends... And they
    have the nerve to say that you don't deserve it all! Well, OK, there's been
    some insider information here and there, some occasional deceptive billing
    and sometimes you've held monopolostic positions, true. But hey! That's how
    business works! And the future looks even brighter, now that the foolish,
    short-lived energy efficiency hype has died... not to mention new energy
    sources in both the renewable and fossil fronts. You can't stop progress,
    that's for sure!
