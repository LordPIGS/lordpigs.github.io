  WELCOME TO MERIDIA
  ------------------

  *Despite the predictions of the national gurus, the economic downturn has
  hit the sunny lands of Meridia! And it has hit hard, so hard that the
  Republic's bigwigs have fled the country for the greener pastures of
  diverse fiscal paradises, taking their ill-gotten fortunes with them.
  The country is in disarray, in dire need of new leaders...*

  *And that's where you come in. Will you rekindle the fire of Meridia's
  economy, while assuring the quality of life of its citizens? Or will you
  use your privileged position to amass a personal fortune?*

  <center><em><strong>Up to you to decide!</strong></em></center>

  -----

  Lord of the P.I.G.S. is a fast-paced multiplayer economy simulation game
  set in the fictional Republic of Meridia, a melting pot of southern
  European countries. You and your friends will take the role of Meridia's
  leaders and will vie for economic supremacy through presentation meetings,
  voting sessions, public opinion polls, unexpected events and widespread
  backstabbing.

  The game is not ready to ship yet, and itâ€™s going to be funded soon via
  **Kickstarter**, where you can help it become a reality and get your copy
  of the game and many extra content!

  GAMEPLAY
  --------

  The Lord of the P.I.G.S. is a game for 4 players and takes up to 30 minutes
  to complete. It will come in a convenient, portable box that holds all
  the contents you need to play, anytime, anywhere:

  + 4 different Action decks (1 for each Character) of 29 cards each, for a
    total of 116 cards.
  + 1 Event deck with 20 cards.
  + 1 Board, with 5 score markers.

  Each player takes up the role of one of the economy's pillars: President
  of the Republic, Chief Banker, Corporate Director and Energy Tycoon.
  Each pillar, or Character, has an associated variable, that represents its
  interests. There's a 5<sup>th</sup> non playable Actor that represents the
  interests of the People, with its own variable associated. Your goal: 

  <center><strong><em>Further your own interests and decide the fate of the
  masses!</em></strong></center>

  -----

  The game is based around 2 central mechanics:

  + **SUBMITTING ACTIONS**: The players submit Actions to alter the economy
  and mold it to their interests. Each Action has a support threshold to be
  activated.
  + **VOTING ACTIONS**: The players choose to which submitted Actions they
  will give their support through Voting. Once a submitted Action reaches its
  Votes threshold, it is activated and influences the 5 Ratings.

  However, to spice things up, the game contains 2 secondary mechanics to
  ensure plenty of suprises and backstabbing in each gaming session:

  + **SPECIAL ACTION CARDS**: Some Action cards can be used for a special
  effect, in addition to the normal uses of submitting and voting. Some let
  you rig the voting system at the last minute, while others let you modify
  the effects of activated Actions. Enjoy!
  + **EVENT CARDS**: The Event deck contains cards that represent
  unpredictable occurrences in the economy and society. Those Events change
  the gameplay, forcing the players to adapt.
